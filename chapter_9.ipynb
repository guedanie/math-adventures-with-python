    "A `class` is a structure that lets you create new types of objects. The object types (usually just called *objects*) can have *properties*, which are vriables, and *methods*, which are functions. THere are time you want to draw multiple objects using Python, but drawing lots of them would be way too much work. Classes make drawing several obejcts with the same properties easy, but they require a specific syntax you'll need to learn. \n",
